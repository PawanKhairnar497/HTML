 ### BLOCK ELEMENT: A block-level element always begins on a new line & browsers add a margin (a space) before  & after the element by default. A block-level element always occupies the entire available width (Stretches out ot the left & right as far as possible). "p" & "div" are the two often used block componenets. "address", "footer", "main", "nav","table","header", "section","canvas","article" etc, these are the examples of "Block element".
